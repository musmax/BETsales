# BETsales is a simple e-commerce which I model after popular site of Jumia. User can only view the content while only the admin reserves the exclusive right to add content. This project was implemented using Sequelize, ExpressJS, Vanilla JavaScript. Postman was used for documentation and Jira was used for task management. The API's were also subjected to testing which was organically written.
we have several models which includes Product Model, Variation Model, User Model, Variation Option Model, BillingAddress Model, Image Model(which was powered with multer) there saving the image directly to database instead of the normal link path(Rookie move I guess), Promotion Model, AddToCart Model and several others.
I follow the usual breaking down of the project into folders : services which contains the actions been each API can return. Controller which is where we called the functions written inside the Services. Model which contains the tables and association between them. Middlewares to control third party platforms and the natural node moules which houses most of the NPM packages that I used in the project.
This simple project exposed me to real life usage of all I was taught in the bootcamp.
